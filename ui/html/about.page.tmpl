  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    This is a full-stack Go web application called Snippetbox that lets people
    paste and share snippets of text â€” a bit like GitHub's Gists or Pastebin.
  </p>
  <h4>Features</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Save and view snippets.</li>
    <li>Middleware.</li>
    <li>RESTful routing.</li>
    <li>SSL/TLS web server using HTTP 2.0.</li>
    <li>User authentication. User can signup and login.</li>
    <li>Leveled logging.</li>
    <li>Data persistence using MySQL database.</li>
    <li>Dynamic HTML using Go templates.</li>
    <li>Session management.</li>
    <li>Web security.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Dependencies</h4>
  <p>
    This project is all based on the standard library. You don't need a
    framework to build web applications in Go. Go's standard library contains
    almost all the tools that you need, even for a moderately complex
    application. The book teaches you to build web applications using the
    standard library (rather than using a specific framework like Echo, Chi or
    Gin). A few small external packages are used where it makes sense for
    security reasons and to reduce complexity.
